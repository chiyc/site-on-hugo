Our head of engineering announced he'll be leaving the company for another opportunity. I'm excited for him, of course, but I'm definitely sad to see him go.

Aaron was the first person I talked to during the hiring process, and that conversation was a key part of why I decided to join the company. 
And although he's the best department head I've ever worked with in any engineering organization, I'm actually not worried about what we'll do without him. He leaves behind a lasting legacy, which includes an amazing engineering culture.

His leadership during our time working together contributed greatly to my growth and happiness as a software engineer. I could honestly write several essays about the things he did and what I've learned from him, but I want to focus on one thing Aaron did exceptionally well: asking questions.

## "What's the worst part of your job?"
I think this is Aaron's signature question. I've heard it countless times. It's come up in every 1-on-1, and although my responses varied in seriousness, he always took what I was saying seriously.

Once, I didn't really have any complaints, so I jokingly pulled out something like "oh, I guess commuting sometimes sucks." And in response, he reassured me that although I said it somewhat in jest, I have the trust and freedom to work remotely.

Another time, my complaint was I that I had too many things I wanted to get done.

It wasn't just that Aaron is good at asking questions either. He's great at following up.

"What can I do to help?"

"What could you do to address that?"

"What else?"

I'll list the questions chronologically, roughly in the order I encountered them. Note these are paraphrased in my own words. I only hope I've expressed their intent as sincerely as Aaron could. 

### Is there a way you could ___?

This was posed to me during some coaching in the first interview while I worked through a technical problem over the phone. Aaron asked how I would go about implementing a spellcheck feature for their search product. I chose to describe how I'd build a naive spellcheck from scratch, and I was getting stuck on a pretty suboptimal approach. With this question, Aaron gently coached me to a solution with much better time complexity. Coming out it, I thought I bombed the phone screen and was prepared to be rejected.

### If you could pick an engineering superpower or skill to master, what would it be?

In the same phone call, we talked about the technical areas I've started developing expertise in as well as what I'm interested in learning. 

### Is there anything you experienced at other companies you've worked at that you would like to see or bring here?



### What's the worst part of your job? And what can I do to fix it? What could you do to help fix it?

And this is Aaron's famed question that he asks at every 1-on-1. Not to mention that he meets regularly with everyone in a department of about 30 engineers. 

### What else?

Another typical Aaron question, asked in both full curiosity and open-endedness, usually following up to questions about what's on my mind or what's been going on.
