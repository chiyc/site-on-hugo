Our head of engineering just announced he'll be leaving the company for another opportunity. I'm excited for him, of course, but I'm definitely sad to see him go.

Aaron was the first person I talked to during the hiring process, and that conversation was a key part of why I decided to join the company. 
And although he's the best department head I've ever worked with in an engineering organization, I'm actually not worried about what we'll do without him. He leaves behind a lasting legacy, which includes an amazing engineering culture.

His leadership during our time working together contributed greatly to my growth and happiness as a software engineer. I could honestly write many essays about the things he did and what I've learned from him, but I want to focus on one thing Aaron did exceptionally well: asking questions.

My first phone screen during hiring was with Aaron. 


These questions are paraphrased in my own words. I only hope I've expressed their intent and sincerity as meaningfully as Aaron could. 

If you could pick an engineering superpower or skill to master, what would it be?

Is there anything you experienced at other companies you've worked at that you would like to see or bring here?

What's the worst part of your job? And what can I do to fix it? What could you do to help fix it?



What makes Storyblocks engineering culture great?
What about the company as a whole?
